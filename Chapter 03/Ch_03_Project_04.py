(Science: day of the week)

Zellerâ€™s congruence is an algorithm developed by Christian Zeller to calculate the day of the week. The formula is

h = (q + 26(m+1)//10 + k + k//4 +j//4 +5j) % 7

where

- h is the day of the week (0: Saturday, 1: Sunday, 2: Monday, 3: Tuesday, 4: Wednesday, 5: Thursday, 6: Friday).
- q is the day of the month.
- m is the month (3: March, 4: April, ..., 12: December). January and February are counted as months 13 and 14 of the previous year.
- j is year//100.
- k is the year of the century (i.e., year % 100).


Write a program that prompts the user to enter a year, month, and day of the month, and then it displays the name of the day of the week.
