(Financial application: compute future tuition)

Suppose that the tuition for a university is $10,000 this year and increases
5% every year. In one year, the tuition will be $10,500. Write a program that
displays the tuition in 10 years and the total cost of 4 yearsâ€™ worth of
tuition starting after the 10th year.
